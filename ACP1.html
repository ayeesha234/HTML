    Coding is the process of writing instructions that a computer can understand and follow. These instructions are written
    in special languages called programming languages (like Python, Java, or C++). Coding helps create websites, apps,
    games, and even control machines. In simple words, coding is how humans “talk” to computers to make them do tasks.
